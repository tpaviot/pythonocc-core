%define STDSELECTDOCSTRING
"The StdSelect package provides the following services:

-  the definition of selection modes for topological shapes

-  the definition of several concrete filtertandardSelection2d.ap classes

-  2D and 3D viewer selectors.

Note that each new Interactive Object must have all its selection modes defined.
Standard Classes is useful to build3D Selectable Objects, and to process3D Selections:

- Implementation of View Selector for dynamic selection in Views from V3d.

- Implementation of Tool class to decompose 3D BRep Objects into sensitive Primitives for every
desired mode of selection(selection of vertex,edges,wires,faces,...)

- Implementation of dedicated Sensitives Entities:
Text for 2D Views (linked to Specific 2D projectors.)"
