If PerformNow equals false, the intersection will be computed later by the function Build. The constructed shape will be returned by the function Shape. This is a compound object composed of edges. These intersection edges may be built: - on new intersection lines, or - on coincident portions of edges in the two intersected shapes. These intersection edges are independent: they are not chained or grouped in wires. If no intersection edge exists, the result is an empty compound object. Note that other objects than TopoDS_Shape shapes involved in these syntaxes are converted into faces or shells before performing the computation of the intersection. A shape resulting from this conversion can be retrieved with the function Shape1 or Shape2. Parametric 2D curves on intersection edges No parametric 2D curve (pcurve) is defined for each elementary edge of the result. To attach such parametric curves to the constructed edges you may use a constructor with the PerformNow flag equal to false; then you use: - the function ComputePCurveOn1 to ask for the additional computation of a pcurve in the parametric space of the first shape, - the function ComputePCurveOn2 to ask for the additional computation of a pcurve in the parametric space of the second shape, in the end, - the function Build to construct the result. Approximation of intersection edges The underlying 3D geometry attached to each elementary edge of the result is: - analytic where possible, provided the corresponding geometry corresponds to a type of analytic curve defined in the Geom package; for example, the intersection of a cylindrical shape with a plane gives an ellipse or a circle; - or elsewhere, given as a succession of points grouped together in a BSpline curve of degree 1. If you prefer to have an attached 3D geometry which is a BSpline approximation of the computed set of points on computed elementary intersection edges whose underlying geometry is not analytic, you may use a constructor with the PerformNow flag equal to false. Then you use: - the function Approximation to ask for this computation option, and - the function Build to construct the result. - Note that as a result, approximations will only be computed on edges built on new intersection lines. - Example You may also combine these computation options. In the following example: - each elementary edge of the computed intersection, built on a new intersection line, which does not correspond to an analytic Geom curve, will be approximated by a BSpline curve whose degree is not greater than 8. - each elementary edge built on a new intersection line, will have: - a pcurve in the parametric space of the intersected face of shape S1, - no pcurve in the parametric space of the intersected face of shape S2. // TopoDS_Shape S1 = ... , S2 = ... ; Standard_Boolean PerformNow = Standard_False; BRepAlgoAPI_Section S ( S1, S2, PerformNow ); S.ComputePCurveOn1 (Standard_True); S.Approximation (Standard_True); S.Build(); TopoDS_Shape R = S.Shape();

To attach parametric curves like this to the constructed edges you have to use: - the function ComputePCurveOn1 to ask for the additional computation of a pcurve in the parametric space of the first shape, - the function ComputePCurveOn2 to ask for the additional computation of a pcurve in the parametric space of the second shape. This must be done before calling this function. Approximation of intersection edges The underlying 3D geometry attached to each elementary edge of the result is: - analytic (where possible) provided the corresponding geometry corresponds to a type of analytic curve defined in the Geom package; for example, the intersection of a cylindrical shape with a plane gives an ellipse or a circle; or - elsewhere, given as a succession of points grouped together in a BSpline curve of degree 1. If, on computed elementary intersection edges whose underlying geometry is not analytic, you prefer to have an attached 3D geometry which is a Bspline approximation of the computed set of points, you have to use the function Approximation to ask for this computation option before calling this function. You may also have combined these computation options: look at the example given above to illustrate the use of the constructors.

These functions return true if an ancestor face F is found, or false if not. An ancestor face is identifiable for the edge E if the following conditions are satisfied: - the first part on which this algorithm performed its last computation is a shape, that is, it was not given as a surface or a plane at the time of construction of this algorithm or at a later time by the Init1 function, - E is one of the elementary edges built by the last computation of this section algorithm. To use these functions properly, you have to test the returned Boolean value before using the ancestor face: F is significant only if the returned Boolean value equals true.
