This and the above classes construct a framework for  
computing the section lines of:  
-       two shapes Sh1 and Sh2, or  
-       shape Sh and plane Pl,  or  
-       shape Sh and surface Sf, or  
-       surface Sf and shape Sh, or  
-       two surfaces Sf1 and Sf2,  
  and builds a result if PerformNow equals true, its  
default value. If PerformNow equals false, the intersection  
will be computed later by the function Build.  
 The constructed shape will be returned by the function Shape.  
This is a compound object composed of edges. These  
intersection edges may be built:  
-      on new intersection lines, or  
-      on coincident portions of edges in the two intersected    shapes.  
  These intersection edges are independent: they are not  
chained or grouped in wires. If no intersection edge exists, the  
result is an empty compound object.  
Note that other objects than TopoDS_Shape shapes involved in  
these syntaxes are converted into faces or shells before  
performing the computation of the intersection. A shape  
resulting from this conversion can be retrieved with the  
function Shape1 or Shape2.  
Parametric 2D curves on intersection edges  
No parametric 2D curve (pcurve) is defined for each elementary  
edge of the result. To attach such parametric curves to the  
constructed edges you may use a constructor with the PerformNow  
flag equal to false; then you use:  
-      the function ComputePCurveOn1 to ask for  
   the additional computation of a pcurve in the parametric  
   space of the first shape,  
-      the function ComputePCurveOn2 to ask for  
   the additional computation of a pcurve in the parametric  
   space of the second shape, in the end,  
-      the function Build to construct the result.  
  Approximation of intersection edges  
  The underlying 3D geometry attached to each elementary edge  
of the result is:  
-       analytic where possible, provided the corresponding  
   geometry corresponds to a type of analytic curve  
   defined in the Geom package; for example, the intersection  
   of a cylindrical shape with a plane gives an ellipse or a    circle;  
-       or elsewhere, given as a succession of points grouped  
   together in a BSpline curve of degree 1.  
If you prefer to have an attached 3D geometry which is a  
BSpline approximation of the computed set of points on  
computed elementary intersection edges whose underlying geometry  
is not analytic, you may use a constructor with the PerformNow  
flag equal to false. Then you use:  
-      the function Approximation to ask for this  
   computation option, and  
-      the function Build to construct the result.  
-      Note that as a result, approximations will only be  
   computed on edges built on new intersection lines.  
-      Example  
You may also combine these computation options. In the following example:  
- each elementary edge of the computed intersection,  
  built on a new intersection line, which does not  
 correspond to an analytic Geom curve, will be approximated by  
  a BSpline curve whose degree is not greater than 8.  
- each elementary edge built on a new intersection line, will have:  
- a pcurve in the parametric space of the intersected face of shape S1,  
- no pcurve in the parametric space of the intersected face of shape S2.

The constructed shape will be returned by the function Shape.  
This is a compound object composed of edges. These  
intersection edges may be built:  
-      on new intersection lines, or  
-      on coincident portions of edges in the two intersected shapes.  
These intersection edges are independent: they are not chained  
or grouped into wires.  
If no intersection edge exists, the result is an empty compound object.  
The shapes involved in the construction of section lines can  
be retrieved with the function Shape1 or Shape2. Note that other  
objects than TopoDS_Shape shapes given as arguments at the  
construction time of this framework, or to the Init1 or  
Init2 function, are converted into faces or shells before  
performing the computation of the intersection.  
Parametric 2D curves on intersection edges  
No parametric 2D curve (pcurve) is defined for the elementary  
edges of the result. To attach parametric curves like this to  
the constructed edges you have to use:  
-      the function  
ComputePCurveOn1 to ask for the additional computation of a  
pcurve in the parametric space of the first shape,  
-      the function  
   ComputePCurveOn2 to ask for the additional computation of a  
   pcurve in the parametric space of the second shape.  
This must be done before calling this function.

-      elsewhere, given as a succession of points grouped

  If, on computed elementary intersection edges whose  
underlying geometry is not analytic, you prefer to have an  
attached 3D geometry which is a Bspline approximation of the  
computed set of points, you have to use the function Approximation  
to ask for this computation option before calling this function.  
You may also have combined these computation options: look at the

Identifies the ancestor faces of  
the intersection edge E resulting from the last  
computation performed in this framework, that is, the faces of  
the two original shapes on which the edge E lies:  
-      HasAncestorFaceOn1 gives the ancestor face in the first shape, and  
-      HasAncestorFaceOn2 gives the ancestor face in the second shape.  
  These functions return true if an ancestor face F is found, or false if not.  
  An ancestor face is identifiable for the edge E if the following  
conditions are satisfied:  
-  the first part on which this algorithm performed its  
   last computation is a shape, that is, it was not given as  
a surface or a plane at the time of construction of this  
algorithm or at a later time by the Init1 function,  
- E is one of the elementary edges built by the  
last computation of this section algorithm.  
To use these functions properly, you have to test the returned  
Boolean value before using the ancestor face: F is significant  
only if the returned Boolean value equals true.") HasAncestorFaceOn2;
