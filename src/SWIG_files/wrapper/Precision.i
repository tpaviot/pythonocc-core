Note : The tolerance of angular equality can be used when working with scalar products or cross products since sines and angles are equivalent for small angles. Therefore, in order to check whether two unit vectors are perpendicular : gp_Dir D1, D2 ; D1 = ... D2 = ... you can use : If ( Abs( D1.D2 ) < Precision::Angular() ) ...

This function provides an acceptable level of precision for an approximation process to define adjustment limits. The tolerance of approximation is designed to ensure an acceptable computation time when performing an approximation process. That is why the tolerance of approximation is greater than the tolerance of confusion. The tolerance of approximation is equal to : Precision::Confusion() * 10. (that is, 1.e-6).

The tolerance of confusion is equal to 1.e-7. The value of the tolerance of confusion is also used to define : - the tolerance of intersection, and - the tolerance of approximation. Note : As a rule, coordinate values in Cas.Cade are not dimensioned, so 1. represents one user unit, whatever value the unit may have : the millimeter, the meter, the inch, or any other unit. Let's say that Cas.Cade algorithms are written to be tuned essentially with mechanical design applications, on the basis of the millimeter. However, these algorithms may be used with any other unit but the tolerance criterion does no longer have the same signification. So pay particular attention to the type of your application, in relation with the impact of your unit on the precision criterion. - For example in mechanical design, if the unit is the millimeter, the tolerance of confusion corresponds to a distance of 1 / 10000 micron, which is rather difficult to measure. - However in other types of applications, such as cartography, where the kilometer is frequently used, the tolerance of confusion corresponds to a greater distance (1 / 10 millimeter). This distance becomes easily measurable, but only within a restricted space which contains some small objects of the complete scene.

This function provides an acceptable level of precision for an intersection process to define the adjustment limits. The tolerance of intersection is designed to ensure that a point computed by an iterative algorithm as the intersection between two curves is indeed on the intersection. It is obvious that two tangent curves are close to each other, on a large distance. An iterative algorithm of intersection may find points on these curves within the scope of the confusion tolerance, but still far from the true intersection point. In order to force the intersection algorithm to continue the iteration process until a correct point is found on the tangent objects, the tolerance of intersection must be smaller than the tolerance of confusion. On the other hand, the tolerance of intersection must be large enough to minimize the time required by the process to converge to a solution. The tolerance of intersection is equal to : Precision::Confusion() / 100. (that is, 1.e-9).

The parametric tolerance of confusion is designed to give a mean value in relation with the dimension of the curve or the surface.

The value of the parametric tolerance of confusion is also used to define : - the parametric tolerance of intersection, and - the parametric tolerance of approximation. Warning It is rather difficult to define a unique precision value in parametric space. - First consider a curve (c) ; if M is the point of parameter u and M' the point of parameter u+du on the curve, call 'parametric tangent' at point M, for the variation du of the parameter, the quantity : T(u,du)=MM'/du (where MM' represents the distance between the two points M and M', in the real space). - Consider the other curve resulting from a scaling transformation of (c) with a scale factor equal to 10. The 'parametric tangent' at the point of parameter u of this curve is ten times greater than the previous one. This shows that for two different curves, the distance between two points on the curve, resulting from the same variation of parameter du, may vary considerably. - Moreover, the variation of the parameter along the curve is generally not proportional to the curvilinear abscissa along the curve. So the distance between two points resulting from the same variation of parameter du, at two different points of a curve, may completely differ. - Moreover, the parameterization of a surface may generate two quite different 'parametric tangent' values in the u or in the v parametric direction. - Last, close to the poles of a sphere (the points which correspond to the values -Pi/2. and Pi/2. of the v parameter) the u parameter may change from 0 to 2.Pi without impacting on the resulting point. Therefore, take great care when adjusting a parametric tolerance to your own algorithm.
