Overview
--------

pythonOCC is a python library whose purpose is to provide 3D modeling features.
It's intended to
developers who aim at developing a complete CAD/PLM application, and to
engineers who want to have a total control over the data during complex design
activities.

About this document
-------------------

This file explains how to build pythonocc-core from source on Windows, Linux or
MacOSX platforms.

Requirements
------------

pythonOCC needs the following libraries or programs to be installed before you
can compile/use it :

- the python programming language (http://www.python.org). Python 2.7 and 3.x
 are officially supported,

- OpenCascade Community Edition 0.16 (https://github.com/tpaviot/oce),

- SWIG 2.0.10 or higher (http://www.swig.org),

- CMake 2.8 or higher (http://www.cmake.org).

**Important**: the OCE version has to match the pythonocc-core version, which is currently **0.16**

pythonocc-core compilation
--------------------------

    cd pythonocc-core
    mkdir cmake-build
    cd cmake-build

The configuration steps uses cmake:

    cmake ..

By default, cmake looks for oce include headers in /usr/local/include/oce and
libraries in /usr/local/include/lib. If these paths don't match your
installation, you have to set OCE_INCLUDE_PATH and OCE_LIB_PATH:

    cmake -DOCE_INCLUDE_PATH=/your_oce_headers -DOCE_LIB_PATH=/your_lib_dir ..


And launch the build process

    make

If you have many cpus, you can increase the compilation speed with:

    make -j$ncpus

According to your machine/os/ncpus, the total compilation time shold be
between 5 to 15 minutes.

Then

    make install

You may require admin privileges to install

    sudo make install

test
----
In order to check that everything is ok, run the pythonocc unittest suite:

    cd ../test
    python run_tests.py


You can also run the examples avalaible in the pythonocc-core/examples
directory.
